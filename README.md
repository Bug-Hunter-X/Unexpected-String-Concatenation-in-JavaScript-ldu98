# Unexpected String Concatenation in JavaScript
This example demonstrates a common error in JavaScript where the + operator unexpectedly performs string concatenation instead of numerical addition when one of the operands is a string.
The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version using `parseInt` to ensure numerical addition.
This is a crucial point to understand for beginners in JavaScript to avoid unexpected results in their programs.
